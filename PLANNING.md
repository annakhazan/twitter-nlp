## System Objectives

* This program aims to provide a sense of what recent Twitter activity looks like for a particular topic. This is accomplished by providing a summary of the general types of tweets and user habits related to the selected topic, an analysis of the general sentiment of related tweets, and a list of words that are commonly associated with the topic.

## System Inputs

* The system will prompt you to enter a topic to analysis, in the form of a string

## System Outputs

* The system will provide a summary of some high-level statistics, sentiment analysis, and commonly associated words. The summary will be printed in the command line where this program is run, and will also write a csv in the `data` folder of the program repository that provides some additional details of up to 1,000 recent and related tweets.
